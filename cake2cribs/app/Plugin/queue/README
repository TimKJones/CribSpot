  E Plugin for CakePHP


  ---- Queue is a CakePHP plugin for interfacing with beanstalkd, a fast,
       distributed, in-memory workqueue service.

  Synopsis
  --------
  This plugin was started with the idea that it may become a place for
  classes connecting to various kinds[1] of queues. However since ages there
  has support for beanstalkd only, which is a fantastic queue btw.
