	We’ve all been at that point where we need to find off-campus housing. As Michigan students ourselves, we’ve faced those same questions of who to live with, where to look, and how much to pay. It may be one of the most stressful times during college as most rentals are signed by the end of September. Those that are not already leased can only be found by searching across forty plus realtor sites. We realized that there had to be a better solution and began building this site last summer. Our initial goal was to, if nothing else, create a cool site that makes the Ann Arbor housing search a little less painful. However, we ultimately see A2 Cribs as the place to make a student’s housing search as simple, quick, and transparent as possible. Thanks for checking out the site. We hope you find it helpful.
